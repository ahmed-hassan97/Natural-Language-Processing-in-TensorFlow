## To look out your model use this api in keras

                     model.summary()

## Description :point_left:


in this project you will learn use the Tokenizer to prepare your text to be used by a neural network by converting words into

numeric tokens, and sequencing sentences from these tokens. 

and you'll learn about Embeddings, where these tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimension space.

With Embeddings and labelled examples, these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar

direction in the vector space. 

This will begin the process of training a neural network to udnerstand sentiment in text -- and you'll begin by looking at movie

reviews, training a neural network on texts that are labelled 'positive' or 'negative' and determining which words in a sentence

drive those meanings.
